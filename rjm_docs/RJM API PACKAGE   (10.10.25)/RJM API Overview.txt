RJM API Overview
October 10, 2025
⸻
Purpose
The RJM Packaging System has been formally codified into two APIs:
1. Persona Database API (data layer)
2. Packaging API (build layer)
Together, these form a modular system that allows brands, agencies, and publishers to
generate RJM persona programs directly from their own environments while all proprietary build
logic remains securely housed within Real Juice Media.
⸻
Architecture
MCP → RAG → Agentic → Persona Database API → Packaging API → LocalX (Delivery)
• MCP (Model Context Protocol): defines the cultural and creative parameters.
• RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): maps those insights to behavioral and scale data.
• Agentic Layer: converts insight into structured programs using RJM logic.
• Persona Database API: hosts the 167 canonical RJM personas (expandable to 500+).
• Packaging API: assembles brand-ready persona frameworks for activation.
⸻
Core Features
• 167 personas mapped to LocalX inventory and LiveRamp IDs.
• Proprietary Foreman build logic protected inside RJM.
• Outputs include brand description, key identifiers, personas, insights, and demos.
• Scalable design—each call generates a complete RJM persona package.
• Manual export option for partners without API access.
⸻
Integration Readiness
• JSON schemas completed for both APIs (10.10.25).
• Spec sheets finalized and attached for partner review.
• LocalX already recognizes all 167 personas.
⸻
Next Steps
1. Provide specifications to Locality engineering and product teams.
2. Schedule API test run inside LocalX (Q4 2025).
3. Validate proof of concept through live campaign delivery.
4. Expand dataset to 300–500 personas in early 2026.
⸻
Strategic Value
• Establishes RJM as a programmable cultural layer—a bridge between data, creativity, and
media.
• Converts proprietary persona architecture into a scalable integration system.
