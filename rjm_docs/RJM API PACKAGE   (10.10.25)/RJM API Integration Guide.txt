RJM API Integration Guide 10.10.25
Purpose
This document outlines how Real Juice Media’s (RJM) cultural media system integrates within
partner platforms. It serves as the practical companion to the RJM API Overview, translating
RJM’s logic and architecture into actionable connection steps.
⸻
1. Core Objective
RJM provides a programmable cultural layer for advertising — connecting mindsets, passions,
and identities to scalable media execution.
The API allows partners to integrate RJM’s persona-based cultural architecture directly into their
own planning, targeting, and creative workflows. It converts RJM’s proprietary persona logic and
packaging process into structured, on-demand audience programs for activation.
⸻
2. System Design
The API architecture is modular, secure, and built for interoperability.
Partners can ingest, query, and deploy persona programs in real time. The output maintains
RJM’s consistent structure: audience identity (the why and how behind behavior) aligned to
brand-specific creative and media strategy.
⸻
3. Core APIs
Persona Database API
Description:
Provides structured access to RJM’s persona library.
Partner Touchpoint:
Partners use this layer to align their audience and inventory taxonomies with RJM’s architecture.
⸻
Packaging API
Description:
Automates the assembly of persona clusters (6–20 personas per program) based on campaign
inputs such as category, creative positioning, and audience goals.
Partner Touchpoint:
Partners upload campaign briefs, brand inputs, or RFP information through their own interface.
The API generates recommended RJM persona programs.
⸻
Processing Logic (MCP → RAG → Agentic)
Description:
Connects RJM’s internal model layers:
• MCP (Model Context Processing): Interprets brand inputs and campaign metadata.
• RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Matches brand attributes and intent to relevant
persona architecture.
• Agentic Layer: Generates structured recommendations and insights for activation.
• MIRA (RJM AI Agent): Orchestrates the above processes in real time, managing flow from
brand inputs through final persona output.
Partner Touchpoint:
Partners receive packaged outputs — persona programs, insight summaries, and alignment
notes — for direct use within planning tools or AI systems.
⸻
4. Output + Flexibility
Each persona program is generated through MIRA using RJM’s defined architecture (core
personas, supporting insights, and audience scope).
Partners have flexibility to adapt or refine persona program composition.
RJM encourages partner oversight in all final selections to ensure brand campaign fit.

5. Integration Requirements
• Supports standard API authentication (OAuth2).
• JSON output schema conforms to RJM

• Compatible with existing ad-tech systems (DSP, SSP, or proprietary environments).
• No data training transfer required; only structured output is exchanged.
⸻
6. Expected Outcomes
• Faster audience design and deployment.
• Consistent cultural logic across campaign planning.
• Greater interoperability between RJM and partner systems.
• Reduced operational friction between data, planning, and execution layers.
⸻
7. Feedback Loop
Partners are encouraged to share delivery and performance data post-campaign for
optimization and case study development.
This occurs outside the API environment through standard business reporting.
⸻
8. Governance
All proprietary structures — persona definitions, packaging logic, and schema design — remain
the exclusive intellectual property of Real Juice Media.
Partner integrations must adhere to RJM’s creative and data use policies. Any changes,
modifications, or derivative systems require written consent from RJM.
⸻
9. Next Steps
1. Partner technical teams review schema and endpoint documentation.
2. Joint alignment call to confirm ingestion method and workflow mapping.
3. RJM provides sample payloads and validation keys for sandbox testing.
4. Upon validation, partner moves to live integration phase with standard usage agreement.
