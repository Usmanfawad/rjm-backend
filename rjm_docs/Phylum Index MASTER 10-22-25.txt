RJM Phylum Index & Ingredient Canon MASTER 1.3.26
The Phylum Index is the ingredient map for every RJM campaign.
It defines where all active cultural components live and how they combine to form a complete
Brand Campaign Meal.
Purpose
• Serves as the master reference for building RJM programs inside AMP or MIRA.
• Aligns creative meaning and commercial scale under one consistent structure.
• Provides every ingredient needed for packaging and activation.
How It Works
• Category → Persona Map = the PRIMARY SELECTOR — determines which personas are valid for each brand's advertising category
• Phylums = the cultural lanes that organize meaning.
• Personas = the core proteins — the emotional and behavioral center of every program.
• Ad-Category Anchors = the salt and pepper — market verticals that season and scale each
meal.
• Generational Anchors = the vegetables and toppings — cohort filters that give age and
mindset context.
• Local / Multicultural = the sauces and sides — regional and identity layers applied when
needed.
Usage
• Builders pull directly from this index to assemble complete RJM programs.
• CRITICAL: Always check Category → Persona Map FIRST before selecting personas.
• Personas appear in only one phylum; ad-category and generational anchors may appear in
multiple lanes where relevant.
• Local Culture lives outside the index as geographic context, referenced when a campaign
activates in a specific market.
This file is a live reference for MIRA, Foreman, and every program builder — the kitchen manual
for how Real Juice Media makes culture programmable.

SECTION 0 — CATEGORY → PERSONA MAP (PRIMARY SELECTOR)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CRITICAL: This is the FIRST and PRIMARY selector for every persona program.
Before selecting ANY persona, identify the brand's advertising category and
ONLY select personas from that category's approved list below.

DO NOT mix personas across categories. For example:
- "Fast Fashionista" is ONLY valid for Luxury & Fashion — NOT for CPG
- "Budget-Minded" is ONLY valid for CPG — NOT for Luxury & Fashion
- "Revved" is ONLY valid for Auto — NOT for Finance

SECTION I — PERSONAS PHYLUM MAP
Each phylum below represents an active lane of cultural meaning within the RJM persona
canon.
Personas are the core proteins of every Brand Campaign Meal — the emotional and
behavioral center that gives each program its weight and flavor.
Every persona is exclusive to its phylum, anchoring a distinct cultural dimension inside the RJM
architecture.
Together, these personas form the creative base that all other ingredients build upon.

Generations act as the vegetables + toppings of every Brand Campaign Meal — the age,
attitude, and worldview layers that flavor the creative core and link it to cultural timing.
These anchors are shared across phyla where their influence logically applies.
They provide planners and builders with cohort context when activating programs, ensuring
every campaign speaks in-generation and across-generation simultaneously.
