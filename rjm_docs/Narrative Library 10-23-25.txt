RJM Narrative Library | 10.23.25
This internal reference binder defines how RJM products and programs are communicated and
built.
It combines productization and activation — showing how RJM segments are described
in-market and how they assemble into complete brand programs.
⸻
SECTION 1 — PRODUCTIZATION & TAXONOMY
This section features a representative sample of audience segments across RJM’s active
product lines:
These are the active, market-facing entries from the current RJM architecture — including
Personas, Generations, and Local Culture. Each entry includes:
• Segment Name
• Write-Up: the market-facing description featured in the Product Manual
• Persona Insights: exactly two data points
• Demo: Core and Secondary audiences
• Advertising Category: mapped classification
The Narrative Library 10.23.25 and the Phylum Index MASTER 10.22.25 define the current
operational product canon. Packaging Logic MASTER 10.22.25 is the procedural execution of
these sources
Product Manual 2.0 will be released during the holidays to reflect all new segments and
classifications.
⸻
Section 2 — RJM Persona Programs
This section compiles 10–12 completed persona programs across national and local
campaigns.
Each program demonstrates how RJM segments combine into a full cultural activation.
Each program includes:
• Program Description (headline paragraph)
• Key Identifiers
• Persona Highlights (4 total)
• Persona Insights (2 total)
• Demos (Core + Secondary)
• Persona Portfolio (~20 segments)
• Activation Plan
These examples follow the Formatting Constitution outlined in Packaging Logic MASTER
10.22.25 and the audience parameters in Phylum Index MASTER 10.22.25.
⸻
Purpose
Together, these two sections form the actionable narrative binder for RJM’s system.
Section 1 defines what we sell — the productized cultural taxonomy of RJM’s active segments
and their market-facing language.
Section 2 defines how it’s deployed — the operational packaging and activation model that
brings those segments to life inside brand campaigns.
Used jointly, they provide the translation and language layer that connects RJM’s creative
architecture to its technical framework.
They directly inform and align with the Packaging Logic Master, the Official Phylum Index,
and forthcoming Product Manual 2.0, ensuring that every manual build and every
MIRA-generated program speaks the same creative and cultural language.
