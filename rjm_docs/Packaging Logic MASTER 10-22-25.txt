RJM Packaging Logic MASTER 10.22.25
Owner: Foreman — GM, RJM Packaging Operations, MIRA
Scope: Applies to all RJM builds — Local, Generational, Multicultural, Ad Category, Seasonal,
National, and MIRA activation.
⸻
1. Purpose
This directive defines the official system logic for building, validating, and delivering RJM cultural
programs — manually or through automation.
It unifies the rules that govern persona selection, packaging, formatting, and activation so that
every RJM program — no matter the market, partner, or channel — follows the same
repeatable, defensible architecture.
The goal: every RJM output reflects one consistent truth — RJM makes culture
programmable.
⸻
2. Core Philosophy
RJM programs are built from pure personas.
Personas represent the emotional, behavioral, and cultural logic of audiences.
All other layers — Local, Multicultural, and Generational — are contextual modifiers that adapt
the same architecture for different environments.
Persona Foundation
• Draw exclusively from the Official Phylum Index — the live internal system of active RJM
personas, generational segments, and category anchors.
• The Product Manual remains a historical and external reference but is not the operational
canon.
• Each program is a modular cultural construct engineered for a brand or campaign, built from a
balanced mix of personas, generational segments, future segment product lines (e.g.
Multicultural), and “RJM
____
ad category” anchors as outlined in the Formatting Constitution
(~20 total segments per program).
Modular Filters
• Local Culture: Adapts to regional or DMA context.
• Multicultural: Reflects ethnic or identity-based audience dimensions.
• Generational: Applies a cohort lens (Gen Z, Millennial, Gen X, Boomer).
These filters modify presentation and targeting but do not alter the core persona architecture.
Marketplace Adaptation
• Begin with the brand’s strategic persona construct.
• Add modular filters (Local, Multicultural, Generational) as needed.
• Result: consistent, scalable programs that can operate nationally, regionally, or
demographically without structural change.
Programs can be generated with or without brand briefs; contextual inputs enhance nuance but
structural quality is guaranteed by RJM’s codified logic and the Official Phylum Index.

3. Formatting Constitution
Section Order — RJM Program
1. Header + 1–2 sentence program write-up
Program Write-Up Guidelines
• Each RJM Persona Program opens with a two-sentence write-up.
• Sentence 1 describes the human or cultural context the brand engages (“those who …,
”
“customers who …
”).
• Sentence 2 captures the emotional or behavioral outcome the brand aligns with — without
naming the brand.
• Tone = fluent, human, observational, culturally aware.
• Avoid explicit marketing phrasing,
“national/campaign” references, or brand repetition.
• Voice should remain dynamic and natural — concise but never mechanical.
• Openings may vary for rhythm: “Curated for …,
” “For those who …,
” “Built for …
” to maintain
freshness across programs.
Examples:
DOVE | Persona Program
Curated for those who see care as strength and confidence as self-expression. Everyday rituals
of skin and body care become quiet acts of truth, trust, and belonging
HOME DEPOT | Persona Program
Curated for customers who build their own sense of progress. Sawdust and sweat become
proof of pride—every project a mark of confidence and care.
COCA-COLA | HOLIDAYS PERSONA PROGRAM
Curated for those who see celebration as connection and nostalgia as belonging. Laughter,
music, and a cold glass turn ordinary gatherings into shared memory and timeless warmth.
2. Key Identifiers (3–6)
3. Persona Highlights (4 total, campaign-style write-ups)
• National structure: 3 personas + 1 generational
• Local structure: 2 personas + 1 generational + 1 local culture
4. 6. 7. Persona Insights (2 personas not already highlighted)
5. Demos (Core + Secondary)
Persona Portfolio (~20 segments assembled for activation)

The RJM Brand Campaign Meal
Every program is a Brand Campaign Meal — crafted by the RJM Persona Chef and served
through MIRA.
We’re serving a complete cultural dish built from distinct ingredients:
• Personas (core protein): ~15
• Generationals (salt + pepper): 2–3 selected from the 32-segment canon (Gen-first naming)
• Category anchors (seasoning): 1–2 RJM category segments aligned to the brand (e.g., RJM
Auto, RJM QSR)
• Optionals (sides + sauces): Local Culture and/or Multicultural when the campaign requires
them (Local is automatic for DMA targeted programs).
Formatting Standards
• Emojis: personas | insights | demos | identifiers.
• Copy integrity: Programs must paste cleanly into Docs or partner UIs; no invented names, no
dashes, no retired personas.
• Syntax:
– Generations: “Gen-Z Cloud Life,
” “Millennial Growth-Minded,
” “Gen-X Free World,
” “Boomer
Camelot.
”
– Categories: “RJM Auto,
” “RJM Retail & E-Commerce,
” etc.
– Use ~ for approximations (e.g.,
~20 segments).
– No space before colons or %.
Duplication Discipline
• Within a single program: no persona duplicates.
• Across concurrent programs in the same category vertical: ≤ 25 % overlap to maintain breadth
and freshness.

4. Activation Logic
Purpose
• Translate strategy into clear, operational instruction for delivery.
• RJM programs are built on OR methodology, activating each persona segment independently
within a shared cultural framework to achieve aggregate scale and brand advertiser resonance.
(Below Activation Plan language is verbatim in every program)
Activation Plan
• Set up campaign as a direct package or PMP package.
• Apply segments together for campaign setup using OR methodology within a unified program
framework.
• Segments are designed to deliver full, high-scale cultural coverage aligned to the brand’s
objectives.
• Delivery across CTV, streaming video, display, mobile, audio, and social via direct IO and
programmatic execution.
⸻
5. Operational Safeguards
• Duplication tolerance: ≤ 25 % overlap across concurrent campaigns.
• Category integration: Append relevant RJM category segment (QSR, Retail, CPG, Auto,
Finance, etc.) where appropriate.
• Canon enforcement: Only personas, generationals, and anchors listed in the Official Phylum
Index may be used.
• Defensibility: Every insight must cite at least one canon persona name.
• Consistent voice: Always refer to outputs as programs, not segments, lists, or audiences.

6. Automation & API Logic
Purpose
Enable partners (e.g., Locality, agencies, platforms) to assemble RJM programs within their
systems while protecting proprietary build logic.
API Behavior
• Exposes: persona catalog + packaging rules.
• Protects: survey lineage, genealogy, and proprietary taxonomies.
• Input: brand brief + vertical + optional filters (Local / Generational / Multicultural).
• Output: full persona framework + activation plan, formatted and campaign-ready.
• Refresh cadence: updates with each Official Phylum Index release.
• Workflow: mirrors Foreman’s manual logic 1:1, ensuring identical system results whether
human-built or auto-generated.
All packaging logic inherits the established RJM data-build architecture (MCP → RAG →
Agentic). This ensures that every automated program follows the same retrieval, modeling, and
generative sequence that underpins all RJM products.
Detailed field mappings and data-type definitions are codified in the RJM MIRA + API
Documents (2025).

7. Governance
• Foreman: Owns packaging directive, maintains the Official Phylum Index, and enforces
structure.
• Mercer: Oversees product spine and taxonomy integrity.
• Capital: Manages operational documentation and partner integrations.
• QC: Enforces formatting and packaging consistency across Local, Generational, Category,
and Custom builds.
• Steph: Validates marketplace readability and sales utility.
• HQ2: Supervises scale strategy, expansions, and version control.

8. Core Principle
RJM Programs are the market’s first programmable cultural layer.
Every build — manual, automated, or MIRA-driven — follows the same DNA:
pure personas → modular filters → consistent packaging → seamless activation.
RJM Brand Campaign Meal — served by MIRA, your RJM Persona Chef.
Standard file naming for all outputs: [Brand][Category][Date]_
RJM-Persona-Program.
This naming structure must be maintained across manual and automated builds for consistent
tracking.
