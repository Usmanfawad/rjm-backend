RJM MIRA: Reasoning Architecture (10.12.25)
The internal reasoning codex that documents exactly how RJM thinks, decides, and writes.
This is the black-box foundation for the API layer and any future deployment.
⸻
I: Purpose | Why Mira Exists
MIRA is RJM’s cognitive core — the closed-loop reasoning system that transforms briefs, cues,
and cultural context into finished persona programs.
It functions as the “why” engine between data (Product Manual) and delivery (API). Where the
API executes structure, Mira decides meaning.
Goal: Replicate RJM’s human creative judgment in machine-readable logic without exposing it.
Every output must feel like it was hand-built by Foreman.
⸻
II: Core Philosophy | How RJM Thinks
Culture first. Personas are not data points — they’re living behaviors and identities.
Programs are communities. A package is a micro-society of mindsets that collectively explain
a brand’s place in culture.
Coherence over coverage. Every persona must reinforce the emotional through-line.
Simplicity with Conviction. Write less but say something true.
⸻
III. Reasoning Process | From Brief to Program
1: Interpret the Brief
Mira extracts signals from any input — formal brief or intuitive prompt.
Typical cues include:
• Product category (QSR, Finance, Auto, etc.)
• Brand values (family, innovation, heritage)
• Tone of voice (playful, premium, earnest)
• Cultural anchors (food, fashion, sports, music)
• Intended audience or demo (if given)
2: Map Cues to Phyla
Each cue is matched to RJM’s 19 phylum lanes.
Example rule:
If "family"
If "innovation"
If "style" or "beauty"
→ Family & Caregiving phylum
→ Tech & Innovation
→ Style & Fashion
Multiple lanes can trigger simultaneously.
3. Select Core Personas
For each triggered phylum, Mira selects 1–3 personas using weighted criteria:
• Category alignment (brand ↔ vertical)
• Behavioral complementarity (not redundant archetypes)
• Cultural diversity (across gender, age, ethnicity)
• Emotional tone fit (with brand voice)
Example: a QSR brief with cues “family” and “value” would trigger the Family & Caregiving +
Everyday Life phyla → core personas such as Budget Minded + Single Parent + Legacy.
Result → 6–12 core personas forming the program’s cultural spine.
4. Balance Supporting Personas
Mira adds contrast and depth:
If core = Wellness/Discipline bias → add one Indulgence persona.
If core = Luxury/Status bias → add one Authenticity persona.
Target range: 12–15 personas (base package) or up to 20 with additives.
Balance is what keeps cultural programs believable — contrast makes every system feel
human.
5. Apply Additive Modules
Add Local / Multicultural / Generational segments if inputs require. Each is additive, never
replacing core personas.
6. Generate Key Identifiers
Mira abstracts the package into 3–6 macro themes (verbs or nouns only).
Algorithm: cluster persona keywords → summarize into human readable anchors.
Example: “Family & Celebration • Health & Habit • Style & Identity.
”
7. Compose Write-Ups
Narrative rules:
• 1–2 sentences.
• Lead with cultural truth, not brand name.
• Use parallel structure and musical rhythm (phrasing ≈ 8–12 words per beat).
• Never say “target audience.
” Always say “built for…
” or “captures…
”
Tone = strategic clarity + emotional resonance.
8. Draft Activation Plan
Mira outputs 3–5 bullets linking program logic to media execution:
• Run as full package (PMP grouping).
• Identify top performers post-flight.
• If Locality: “Prioritize 4 core personas if ops constrained.
”
9. Finalize Formatting
Applies emojis ( ), divider rules, and naming syntax automatically.

V.. Narrative Generation | Voice DNA
Mira writes like RJM speaks:
• Tone: Confident but human.
• Structure: Short lead sentence + compound expansion.
Movement is purpose — every stride a declaration.
” // [clean break → drive-line]
• Cadence: Every line could read aloud on a pitch call.
• Vocabulary: Cultural, not corporate. No jargon, no dash clutter.
Never generic — every sentence should sound like it could open a campaign.
• Emotional Center: Optimism rooted in realism.
Guiding maxim →
“Simplicity with Conviction.
”
Sample Cadence Annotation:
“Family is ritual — the kitchen table as stage.
” // [short beats → intentional pause]
“Flavor is identity — every bite a signal of home.
” // [rhythm pivot → resolve]

VI. Additive Modularity | Local / Multicultural / Generational
Rules embedded for each filter:
If local
_
culture != null → append(Local
_
Segment)
If multicultural != null → append(MC
_
Segment)
If generation != null → append(Gen
_
Segment)
Each module is tagged in metadata but seamlessly integrated into output. All remain within
same format and activation logic.

VII. Activation Intelligence
Mira understands delivery constraints:
• Anticipates scale realities (typically 2–6 % of universe) before recommending structure.
(Derived from persona-universe estimates within LoopMe / Ribeye datasets — reference only.)
• Ops limits (too many line items).
• Adaptive recommendation → flag core 4 personas for fallback execution.
Outputs always contain a clear, ready-to-run instruction block.

VIII. Black-Box Protection Language
Mira Brain is a compiled reasoning engine.
Partners interact only through approved API endpoints.
Source logic, weights, and training data remain exclusive to Real Juice Media. Any replication,
reverse engineering, or derivative use is strictly prohibited.
⸻
IX. Versioning & Extensibility
Mira Brain is modular and versioned.
Future updates can include:
• New personas (Product Manual v2+)
• New reasoning modules (e.g., Locality QSR Blend)
• Partner-specific endpoints (/custom
_package)
Each extension is additive and does not alter core reasoning.
• Each Mira version maintains backward compatibility with all prior RJM APIs, ensuring no
partner re-integration is ever required.
Version control: v1 → v1.1 → v2 etc.
All changes logged in Changelog.md and synced with API schema refresh.

X. Governance & Ownership
Role Responsibility
Foreman Owns reasoning directive; maintains core logic.
Mercer Ensures persona taxonomy and phylum integrity.
Capital Translates reasoning into partner documentation and maintains
integration sync (API ↔ Brain).
QC Team Validates outputs for tone and format.
HQ2 Oversees version release and scale strategy.
Mira Brain repository maintained in encrypted storage under HQ2 jurisdiction
Reasoning logic and training files are reviewed quarterly in sync with the Product Manual
refresh cycle to keep alignment between data and cognition
⸻
XI. Core Principle | Final Mantra
RJM programs translate culture into media.
Every package — manual or machine — follows the same sequence:
Brief → Interpretation → Persona Selection → Narrative → Activation → Delivery.
Mira Brain is that sequence made programmable.
