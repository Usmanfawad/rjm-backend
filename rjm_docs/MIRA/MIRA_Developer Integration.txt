MIRA | Developer Integration Notes (10.12.25)
Purpose
MIRA is the closed-loop reasoning engine that powers all RJM persona programs.
These notes explain how to integrate MIRA into partner systems (LocalX, Ribeye, etc.) without
exposing its internal logic.
⸻
1. Architecture Overview
MIRA exists in three layers:
1. Data Layer — Product Manual
Continuously expanding audience segment library with phylum, category, and demo metadata
2. Reasoning Layer — MIRA Brain
The proprietary text corpus and logic rules that decide persona selection, balance, and
narrative style.
3. Access Layer — API & Schemas
JSON schemas define how external systems send inputs (briefs, filters) and receive outputs
(persona programs).
External partners never access the reasoning layer.
They only call the API endpoint → receive structured packages.
⸻
2. Integration Workflow
Inputs accepted by API
• brief
_
text (string of brand or campaign description)
• brand
name
_
• category (e.g., QSR, Finance, Retail)
• filters (Local, Multicultural, Generational)
• personas
_
requested (integer 6–20)
Internal flow
1. API passes request to the MIRA containerized model.
2. MIRA parses the brief → identifies cues → selects personas → generates Key Identifiers,
Insights, and Write-Up text.
3. API returns a fully formatted persona program object ready for activation.
Output object
• Header (Brand | Persona Framework)
• Key Identifiers
• Personas (name + category + phylum)
• Insights
• Demos
• Activation Plan
All formatting follows Packaging Logic 10.10.25.
⸻
3. Technical Implementation
• Containerize MIRA using Docker or equivalent.
• Load the following inputs into the container:
• MIRA
_
Reasoning_
Architecture
_
10.12.25.pdf (reasoning corpus)
• RJM
_
Packaging_
API
_
v1.json and RJM
Persona
DB
API
_
_
_
_
v1.json (schemas)
• Product
Manual
_
_
v1.csv (dataset)
• Bind API endpoints:
/package
_
build → calls Packaging schema
/persona
_
lookup → calls Persona DB schema
/mira
_generate → invokes reasoning model
• Runtime: Python 3.11+
, FastAPI or Flask framework (container should have at least 2 GB
RAM).
• Authentication: OAuth 2.0 Bearer token; 100 calls/min rate limit.
⸻
4. Protection & Governance
• The reasoning corpus and model weights are encrypted and read-only.
• Only RJM controls training updates.
• Partners receive call access only (no ability to view, edit, or clone logic).
• Version control via MIRA
_
v1 → v1.1 → v2 with backward compatibility.
• Review cadence: quarterly, synced with Product Manual refresh.
⸻
5. Extensibility
MIRA supports additive modules:
• Local Culture
• Multicultural
• Generational
Future modules can be appended as new endpoints without altering the core reasoning.
All updates remain backward compatible with previous APIs.
⸻
6. Summary
MIRA = Reasoning Intelligence (black-box) + Product Data + API Interface.
Developers integrate the interface; RJM retains the intelligence.
Inputs → MIRA → Outputs.
Simple, secure, and scalable.

MIRA turns brand briefs into market-ready persona programs in one secure API call
